# Deployement

This repos is supposed to be deployed using [GitHub Pages][1].

To do so, you need access to the **Settings** tab in the repo.

1. Go to the **Settings** tab
2. Scroll down to the **GitHub Pages** section
3. Under the **Source** param, click the select list and choose the **master branch** option
4. The page should reload and tell you that the site is being deployed
4. Under the **Theme Chooser** param, click the **Change theme** button, and be sure to select the **Cayman** theme
  > This is important as the site does not support any other theme

From now on, each time you push new commits to the `master` branch, GitHub will redeploy your site with GitHub Pages

## TODO

### Deploy with GitHub

### Add new documentation page
